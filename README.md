# Sir Meowster
This silly little guy is version 2, because my first version was to spagetti to read. 
This is nothing more than a passion project to both learn and have fun, as such, don't expect quality code.
However, if looking at this project helps you in any way, then I think its a win.

# What it does good
- Imports math

# What it does bad
- Social points (Give a bro a point, they can buy things)
- Horse gambling (I dont think I can even explain)
- Shoop (Its a shop... with buttons and stuff...)
- Data storeage (It's probably not as bad as I think it is)

# Why is it so bad?
- Documentation
- Readability

# Seriously though
This bot isnt really something I'm to crazy about, I don't think it'll go anywhere far. But if it does then I hope I make bank.
This is more or less a place for me to dump my code and share it with my friends (who are users of said bot) and keep transparency with them.

I don't care if anyone of them takes the code, and nor do I care about the internet taking my code.
I learn from you, you from me. Or something like that...
